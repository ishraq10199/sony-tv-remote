# sony-tv-remote

## Intent

Initially forked from [here](https://github.com/avinash311/sony-tv-remote), this repo is intended to be used as source control for a simple tv-remote interface for my parents to use at home. Few reasons why:

1. They are older now, so their eyesight is not as it used to be
2. The original remote is cluttered with buttons and inputs, and its also rare and expensive (theirs is broken)
3. They used to be able to get by with a very old tv-sideview app on their phone, which is not available on the play store anymore
4. The app can be installed via an APK from a third-party site, which I find to be a potential security risk

## Edits to make:

1. Remove extra inputs and functionality
2. Change the UI to be friendlier to older people
3. Add in some shortcuts for their most visited channels
4. Minor refactor
